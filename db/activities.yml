  body: "2Tides provide well organized, enjoyable and fun trips to breath taking “wilderness”
    locations in Scandinavia. We are aware that attention to detail is key. We try
    and choose routes that are not only beautiful, but also have remoteness feel
    to it, we try to cater for different fitness levels, as we believe everyone
    should enjoy the true nature! And of course we provide top-of-the-line gear
    for maximum comfort.\r\n \r\nNothing is more spectacular than having your meal
    in the outdoor with all the elements, sitting on sun warmed rocks, hearing the
    waves, feeling the wind on your fore head and watching the sun move slowly across
    the sky.\r\n \r\nSea, Mountains, Forest, Wildlife & Nature – Enjoy Life!!!!\r\nWe
    try and create extraordinary experiences for our guests.\r\nWe like to call
    Scandinavia, the last wilderness of Europe, we have both a beautiful and biologically
    diverse landscape. And as the Scandinavian countries are very scarce populated,
    it’s not hard to go off the beaten path and find our own little place. Other
    than all our equipment and clothing and the occasional sign of other human beings,
    it’s a place where you don’t know what century you’re in.\r\n \r\nOn most of
    our trips, we provide all of the gear, which is top-of-the-line.\r\nWe provision
    all trips and do all the cooking (& cleaning). Our guides take care of all details,
    meaning more time for you to enjoy yourself. Staring at the sea, sky, stars,
    working on your tan, reading a book, go for a swim, socializing with new or
    old friends. Or why not find your own magic spot in the forest or on a rock
    to meditate, paint, draw, write, sing, take photos – simple speaking, enjoy
    life.\r\n \r\nWithout distractions of modern life, mobile phones, computers,
    TVs and so forth. The nature takes over, and with no artificial light. The 24
    hour clock gets replaced by the sun, moon and the stars. And all elements become
    more alive than in your normal life.\r\n \r\nMost importantly to us on 2Tides
    though, is to give you an incredible and enriched experience. Our guides will
    help you learn about everything from nature, environment to gear and new skills.
    And we try to do this in a comfortable, relaxed and fun pace.\r\n \r\nWe look
    forward to seeing you."

  body: "They stopped growing because they let rivals take customers. Their intense
    focus on their own products led to strategy myopia: they saw themselves in the
    railroad business rather than the transportation business. \n\nThe insight that
    proved most striking was that passengers did not take their seats on the train
    until stage eight—most of the experience of train travel, in other words, did
    not involve the train at all. The team reasoned that every one of the prior
    steps was an opportunity to create a positive interaction, oppor- tunities that
    would have been overlooked if they had focused only on the design of the seats."
